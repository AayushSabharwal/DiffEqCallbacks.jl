# Manifold Projection

The following callbacks are designed to provide post-step modifications to preserve
geometric behaviors in the solution.

### Example

Here we solve the harmonic oscillator:

```@example manifold
using OrdinaryDiffEq, DiffEqCallbacks

u0 = ones(2)
function f(du,u,p,t)
  du[1] = u[2]
  du[2] = -u[1]
end
prob = ODEProblem(f,u0,(0.0,100.0))
```

However, this problem is supposed to conserve energy, and thus we define our manifold
to conserve the sum of squares:

```@example manifold
function g(resid,u,p,t)
  resid[1] = u[2]^2 + u[1]^2 - 2
  resid[2] = 0
end
```

To build the callback, we just call

```@example manifold
cb = ManifoldProjection(g)
```

Using this callback, the Runge-Kutta method `Vern7` conserves energy. Note that the
standard saving occurs after the step and before the callback, and thus we set
`save_everystep=false` to turn off all standard saving and let the callback
save after the projection is applied.

```@example manifold
sol = solve(prob,Vern7(),save_everystep=false,callback=cb)
@test sol[end][1]^2 + sol[end][2]^2 â‰ˆ 2
```
